1. Original post from the student, a guess of the bug, and failure-inducing input

   Though this student's code has no failure under his own test case, the method `reverseInPlace` does not look correct because of the usage of parameter `arr.length`.
   So here's my guess of the bug and my failure-inducing input.

   My response:
   `There is something wrong with your reverseInPlace method. Your test case is not sufficient enough. Try to add more tests and think about more scenarios.`
